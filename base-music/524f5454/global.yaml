name: "Rise of the Triad OST NST"
description: |-
  This is a baseset that contains the original soundtrack from Rise of the Triad - The Dark War in MIDI form.
  It does however, intentionally, omit the short tracks and loops from the OST.

  Old Style tends to be music with Orchestral or Traditional Sounding Rythms.
  New Style is anything with a contemporary sound or fast rythm.
  Ezy Street is anything with a slower pace or more repetitious.
