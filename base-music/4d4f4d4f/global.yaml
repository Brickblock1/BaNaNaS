  The Modern Motion Music Pack pays tribute to the spirit of the original music
  from Transport Tycoon Deluxe and composer John Broomhall. Running nearly 99
  minutes long, these 30 songs bring a modern sound to OpenTTD, and should
  inspire gameplay for games in the late 20th and early 21st century. All songs
  here are original compositions from Kit "Monochrome" F, George E. Martin,
  Bjorn Lynne and Brian Dill.
