description: |-
  Bleeding edge version of NoCAB, this version will be used for testing and parts of it will eventually integrate with the main NoCAB releases as it stabilizes over time.

  This version is the first AI to include support all 4 basic transportation types (trains, road vehicles, ships and aeroplanes). It still needs work though, the latest addition (Trains) are far from stable.

  This branch is based on the 1.26 version of NoCAB.
