description: |-
  Bleeding edge version of NoCAB, this version is not compatible with the latest stable release of OpenTTD and can only be played by the trunk version.

  This version will be used for testing and parts of it will eventually integrate with the main NoCAB releases as new versions of OpenTTD are released.

  This branch is based on the 1.17 version of NoCAB.
