  SynTrans stands for Synaptic Transportation.  It creates vast road and aircraft networks.  It is currently planned to include train support soon.

  As a spin off of RoadAI, here are the improvements:
  1.  Aircraft Support
  2.  Save/Load support
  3.  Faster Speed (in most areas)
  4.  Better Vehicle Management
  5.  Smarter station placement
  This release upgrades to SuperLib v27 and fixes a fatal save/load bug
