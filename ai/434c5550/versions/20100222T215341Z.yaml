  Builds only bus routes between towns. Clueless was the first user AI for NoAI published on tt-forums. CluelessPlus is Clueless updated to work with current NoAI API. Extra in the Plus edition:
  1) Now it uses the library pathfinder
  2) plans before building stations -> less annoying for players
  3) buy/sell vehicles based on number of waiting passengers, station usage and rating.

  v16:
  * Ingame changeable settings
  * Bridge over rail/canals
  * Build less parallel roads
  * Repair bus stops
