  CluelessPlus is a simple but nice AI that makes bus routes.

  Clueless was the first user AI for NoAI published on tt-forums. CluelessPlus is Clueless that has been updated to work with current NoAI API. And since then there have been many improvements.

  v17:
  * When a vehicle get hit by a train, try to replace the level crossing by a bridge.
  * Moved some code to SuperLib which is now a dependency.
