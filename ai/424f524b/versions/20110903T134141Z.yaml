description: |-
  A simple AI that uses only trucks.
  It handles all kind of cargo except for mail and passengers.

  v5:
  * The behaviour should be a bit less predictable
  * Don't waste time trying to bring cargo over excessive distances.
  * Improved algorithm for selecting how many trucks build. There won't be long queues waiting at a station any more.
  * Station may be expanded in order to handle a greater number of trucks.
