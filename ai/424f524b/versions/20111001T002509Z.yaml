description: |-
  A simple AI that uses only trucks.
  It handles all kind of cargo except for mail and passengers.

  v6:
  * Initial support for passengers and mail
  * Much improved performance, shouldn't hang any more while doing some task
  * Better performace on medium-sized maps.
  * Better handling of NewGRF, shouldn't crash any more with some of them.
  * Fixed a few bugs here and there (route construction, truck deletion, and many others)
