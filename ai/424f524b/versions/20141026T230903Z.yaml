description: |-
  A simple AI that tries to be fun to play with, and uses buses, trucks and aircrafts.
  It handles all kind of cargo.

  v19:
  Bumped minimum api version to 1.2.
  Savegames are no compatible with older versions.

  Initial handling of trams. Disabled by default because it still has bugs.
  Enabled by default airplanes.
  Fixed some bugs that would happen when trying to find out possible refits of an engine.
