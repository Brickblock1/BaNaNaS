  Rythorn Airline AI by Sevestra Rythorn is a fork of WrightAI that adds some customization without changing too much
  of the underlying mechanics. It also contains code that picks a company name and company president from a list of
  characters from my work in progress book, The Chronicles of Rythorn. Said code was found on the TT-Forums in a
  thread by Asimov answered by Yexo and customized by me.
