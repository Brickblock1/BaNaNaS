description: |-
  An AI that primarily uses road vehicles, with some aircraft as well.

  Will transport passengers and most cargo, and should be broadly compatible with most or all NewGRF's that provide non-articulated RV's that can be refit to the available cargoes.

  NOTE: Currently depends on SuperLib 16, not 17
