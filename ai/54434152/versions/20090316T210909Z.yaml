description: |-
  An AI that builds cars that drive around randomly in your towns.

  You should add a car GRF and specify in the AI settings for this AI how it should detect which vehicles to build. Default settings are compatible with Generic Cars GRF.

  Wait a little, and a version that support save/load will come.
