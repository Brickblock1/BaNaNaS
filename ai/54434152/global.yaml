description: |-
  An AI that builds cars that drive around randomly in your towns.

  You should add a car GRF and specify in the AI settings for this AI how it should detect which vehicles to build. Default settings are compatible with Generic Cars GRF.

  This AI will not be selected as a random AI. In order to use it you must select it in the AI Settings dialog.

  Please let the AI finish buying cars before saving + quitting (it will not resume after load).
