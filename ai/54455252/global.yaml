name: "Terron AI"
description: |-
  Terron is an AI that has been written to be both challenging and interesting to play with it.
  The AI will try to do its best to achieve high profits, but only within strict limits.
  Almost every aspect that limits the AI's behavior can be seen and tweaked in the settings screen.
  By changing different values you can greatly influence AI's performance and adjust it to your needs.
  Hopefully such variety will make this AI an interesting opponent.
