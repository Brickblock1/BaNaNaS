name: "OtviAI"
description: |-
  An AI that focuses on passengers & mail, but will occasionally also do cargo transport.

  Tested with several newgrf's including ECS, 2cc and builds trams and nice cargo stations if available.

  Originally written as a simple test AI for Rondje om de Kerk, but now a complete and strong competitor. Tries to get some subsidies as well.

  Traffic jams, pollution and full maps are the risks of running this AI :)
