description: |-
  An AI that focuses on passengers & mail, but will occasionally also do cargo transport.

  Tested with several newgrf's including ECS, 2cc and builds trams and nice cargo stations if available.

  Originally written as a simple test AI for Rondje om de Kerk, but now a complete and strong competitor. Tries to get some subsidies as well. Planes and boats are in planning only, but will be included later as well.

  Traffic jams, pollution and full maps are the risks of running this AI :)
