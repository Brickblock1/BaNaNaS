  The old version of NoCAB revamped to work with the new NoAI framework. Work will now be done to rewrite parts of the AI to include support for trains and trams and additional features like upgrading existing routes.

  Update:
  1.2 -> 1.3: Updated to new API + partially rewrote some components (getting ready for v2 release! :)).
  1.1 -> 1.2: Fixed a small bug that crashed the AI when a road station couldn't be build.
