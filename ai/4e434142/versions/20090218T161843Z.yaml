description: |-
  The old version of NoCAB revamped to work with the new NoAI framework. Work will now be done to rewrite parts of the AI to include support for trains and trams and additional features like upgrading existing routes.

  Update:
  1.4 -> 1.5: Small bug fix for industry closure and airfield placement.
  1.3 -> 1.4: Loads of bug fixes and optimizations. This will probably be the last release before version 2.
  1.2 -> 1.3: Updated to new API.
