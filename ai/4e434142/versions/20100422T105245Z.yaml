  NoCAB is a competitive AI that tries to compete with other AIs and human players. If features a custom pathfinder and data structures for maximal performance. It can handle trains, road vehicles, aircraft, and ships.

  Update:
  2.0.6: Updated NoCAB to the 1.0 API version. Made the building of the HQ optional. Make sure ships don't get lost.

  Enjoy! :)
