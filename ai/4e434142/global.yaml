  NoCAB is a competitive AI that tries to compete with other AIs and human players. If features a custom pathfinder and data structures for maximal performance. It can handle trains, road vehicles, aircraft, and ships.

  Update:
  2.1.4: Fixed a little bug which made the AI crash when a train connection merged with an existing but discontinued line.

  Enjoy! :)
