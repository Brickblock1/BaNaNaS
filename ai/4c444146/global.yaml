description: |-
  LuDiAI AfterFix is an AI that builds road routes and air routes, transporting either mail or passengers.

  It's an AI that is built upon the original work of lukin_'s LuDiAI. Initial work was on fixing issues found on the original, but it became something more of its own later on.
