  V. SHORT CHANGELOG

  1.1.1 (2010-12-29)
  ------------------------------------
  - Change: AutoRenewMonths to -6 (r91)
  - Fix: A building of road failure didn't actually stop the building of roads (r89)
  - Fix: BuildBusStop() was using wrong sqrt function (built-in instead of in code) (r85)
  - Fix: Another possible lock when another AI built where AI was going to build (r74)
