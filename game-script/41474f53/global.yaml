name: "Global Objective System"
description: "This script gives players a way to create a global challenge/main objective system for all companies in the game to achieve and compete against each other for. It is fully customizable and allows you to add or remove different challenges to the objective and change goal amounts for each challenge through the Game Script configuration in-game. It tries to mimic and is inspired heavily by the challenge system in Chris Sawyer's Locomotion and RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, while also adding features to it."
