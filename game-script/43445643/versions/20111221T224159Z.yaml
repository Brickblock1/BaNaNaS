description: |-
  This Game Script creates one goal per company:
  - Transport at least X cargo items per vehicle during a period of three months

  When a goal is met, X is increased and a new goal is created.

  A sign is displayed over each HQ with the last achieved level.

  New in version 2:
  - Save/load support
  - Move sign when HQ is moved
  - Lower step between levels (10 => 5)
