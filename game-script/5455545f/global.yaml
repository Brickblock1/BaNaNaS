description: |-
  This is the Script part of the Beginner Tutorial. It's actually here most of the logic is located. The scenario is just a ... scenario to ensure that you get a good start. :-)

  Feedback or helping out is welcome.


  Ensure you download both this script, the scenario named "Beginner Tutorial" and the AI named "Beginner Tutorial - Ship AI". Then click on play scenario in the start menu to play the tutorial.
