description: |-
  Silicon Valley challenges every company to turn a specific town into a global production centre for a specialised cargo.

  Every company is assigned a slightly different goal, but they all have the same time period to achieve their goal.

  To achieve the goal, the companies do not only have to transport lots of cargo to and from their town, they also have to fund sufficient industries to produce the cargo.
