description: |-
  RattRoads is an NRT road and tramtype set providing a complete roster of 10 roadtypes (6 normal and [optionally] 4 electrified) plus 2 tramtypes. It has support for American and European road styles, climate-aware graphics, plus many parameters for customizing to your preferred playstyle.

  This is the successor/replacement to the American Road Replacement Set.
  This version is modified by Limyx826 with a small coding change.
