description: |-
  The New Company Colours Set. Enhances and improves upon the default company colours.
  - New colours and shades such as black, crimson and cream
  - Two tone schemes make 2CC highlights pop
  - Full 2CC support - compatible with all company coloured sets, even 32bpp/EZ ones
  - Allows you to represent much more realistic liveries
  - As a side-effect, some colours in the GUI may be  changed, but everything is still perfectly readable
