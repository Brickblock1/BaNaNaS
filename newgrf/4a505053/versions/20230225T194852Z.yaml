description: |-
  First full version now with enough original (albeit imperfect) graphics.

  JP+ Signal Extension to add multiple aspects to the existing japanese signal set.
  requires JGRPP to be of any use.

  two variants of many signals based on the original japanese signal graphics. One for normal sections and one intended for more densely signalled sections.

  two variants of dwarf signal, colour and non colour lights.

  shinkansen block markers will appear on the opposite side of the track.
