name: "OTIS - One Tile Industry Set"
description: |-
  The game starts with no Industries available.
  You have to buy and place the tile representing the Industry you want.
  The 1 tile industries can easily be hidden behind nicer looking structures and then stimulate traffic to areas where you otherwise, for example because of the lack of housing, wouldn't have that.
  There are just 8 different industries.
  But they accept and produce a lot of different cargo's, (in total 64 different cargos) so you can have many different looking vehicles visiting them.
