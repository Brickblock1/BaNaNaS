name: "Fridaemon's Eyecandy Objects"
description: |-
  Main reason for creating this set was to bring supermarkets and hypermarkets into the game. With first shops I'm done. Hypermarkets are based on modular system. You can build them with different size and shape.
  In Fridaemon's Objects there's some Beach Objects as Beach Paths, shops, pool objects, bars on the sea.
  In this set there are few eyecandy underground entrances. For now only road edition. Subway undergrounds comes later.
  Very big THANKS to GarryG and to everyone who inspired me.
