name: "JP+ Bridges"
description: |-
  JP+ Bridges, a variety of bridges inspired by real Japanese bridges.

  Many bridges are full tile width for building side by side modular bridges.

  It is highly recommended to combine with JapanSet Tracks, as the bridge textures are designed to match the urban rail. However, you can use any track set you prefer. A track set is required as JP+ Bridges does not support the vanilla rails.

  Coded by Emperor Jake. GFX by Emperor Jake, Andrew350 and GarryG. Based on code by Wallyweb, Quast65 and Andrew350
