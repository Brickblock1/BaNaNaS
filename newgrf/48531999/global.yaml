  Hungarian Voxel World - Modular Truck Set
  A modular, one vehicle composed from multiple sprites truck set, with european style trucks.
  The aim is to create an universal truck set like GRVTS, but with more realistic looking vehicles.
  All vehicles choose a random brand and model by default, but you could always get a specific one from the dropdown menu in the purchase list.
  Basically it is a MAN truck set now, as no other brands got modeled, will be updated in the future.
