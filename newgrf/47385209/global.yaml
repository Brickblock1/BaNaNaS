  Tired of seeing those little shelters around the bus stops? Want to use NewObjects to decorate your bus station or truck loading bay?

  Well now you can remove those unsightly decorations from the bus and truck stations!

  Please note that this is meant for the use of NRT Roadtypes; it also looks fine with OpenGFX, but if used with default TTD graphics it will reveal a glitch in the matrix (courtesy of Chris Sawyer).
