  Tired of weirdness with default road graphics?

  Remove bus and truck station gfx! Give all bridges full tile ramps! One way signs instead of arrows to mark your one way roads!

  ! IMPORTANT !
  This is meant for NRT in early JGR's Patch Pack versions using an outdated NRT implementation; if used with default gfx it will glitch, and does nothing useful in the current NRT versions of OpenTTD and JGRPP.
