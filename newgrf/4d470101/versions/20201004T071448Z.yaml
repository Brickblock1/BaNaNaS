description: "This set includes 7 passenger and 2 mail trains or ttain cars from High Tatra mountains in Slovakia. NNGT or U&ReRMM 2 is required for trains to run on. Trains are narrow gauge, so they will be best used for regional transport. You can combine this set with SRRS, then NNGT is required."
