name: "Quast65's RoadSet"
description: |-
  Requires minimal OpenTTD version 1.10
  This set offers roads.
  The intention is to make them suitable for vehicles that use labels from the Standardized Road/Tram Type Scheme.
  Further than that, the roads are NOT compatible with the Standardized Road/Tram Type Scheme.
  Can be used in combination with (eyecandy) tramtracks to get a different appearance, without loosing too many of the precious 64 road/tramtype-slots.
