  The landscape is very "curvey". However it does contain some larger islands, to prevent you from starving.

  Note that it's very unlikely to have many big cities on it, and most cities are very hard to connect.

  ---------------------------------

  2023 update: re-generated at 8k resolution.

  It should still be playable at 2k.

  At even smaller resolution, you risk turning it into many disconnected tiny islands.
