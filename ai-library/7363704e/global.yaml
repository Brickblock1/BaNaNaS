name: "SCPClient_NoCarGoal"
description: |-
  This library contains an Script Communication Protocol (SCP) client for AIs that wish to get information about NoCarGoal goals.

  AI authors can just read the NoCarGoal readme and use SCP themself, or use this library that offers a simple API to focus on the cargoes where the NoCarGoal transport goal has not yet been reached.
