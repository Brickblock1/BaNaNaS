  (FULL VERSION WITH INDUSTRY!)
  ~ USES ECS VECTORS! ~

  Welcome to Morrowind, or should I say, welcome to the islands of Vvardenfell and Solstheim.

  Its the year 1935 (19E35), and the events of TES 3 Morrowind have long past, along with the Oblivion crysis and the eruption of Red Mountain.

  Life and civilization have returned to Vvardenfell and people need your help to transport passengers, mail, and goods across and around Vvardenfell.

  Good luck and have fun!
