description: "Tropical map (no desert) made by Scia(podes) with a bunch of small rivers creating one big tropical river. The landscape and town names are inspired on Brazil names. Near the coast mountains are heavily eroded. More inland the mountains are steeper. The map is made from scratch, so the erosion pattern follows the rivers."
