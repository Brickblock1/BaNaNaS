name: "Acadia 1750"
description: |-
  Acadia was a French colony in what is now eastern Canada and Maine. In the mid-1700s, the British drove some 11,000 Acadians from their land; those who resettled in Louisiana became the Cajuns.

  Start in 1750 with ships, wagons, and horse-drawn rail vehicles. Hand-placed towns and FIRS industries.

  For early trains, you will need both NewGRFs from the Early Rail set (not on BaNaNaS): https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=41132#p752653
