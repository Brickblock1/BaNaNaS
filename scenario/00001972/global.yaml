  An alternate history map, where Japan colonised the west coast of North America. 4096*8192, starting in 1865. (Base map from SRTM data obtained via Bother.)

  This is a passenger-only scenario, though you're free to add industries to it. It remains slightly incomplete; there are a few places that I haven't gotten around to adding cities to.

  If you have any comments - or want to share a version with realistic industry placement! - let me know via the OpenTTD Discord server; I'm @Sjiveru.
