  Cuba 1k, By Terec

   -- Requires JGR --

  The biggest and most detailed map of cuba ever made for openttd. Have fun and feel free to report any bugs to me at reddit u/terectec.

   -- HARDCORE VERSION --
  Contains Industries of the Caribbean by 2TallTyler, a much harder version of the cuba map, with appropriate industry and economy.
