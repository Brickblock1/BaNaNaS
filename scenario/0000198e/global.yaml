  JAPAN 1875 (JP+ AXIS)

  NewGRF Requirements:
  - Japan Set3 pack
  - JP+ set
  - AXIS Industry set
  (All should be available on BaNaNas)

  This is the JP+/AXIS industries map for the Japan 1875 scenario. As much attention as possible has been paid to putting primary industries in their historical locations based on the freely-available sources that I've found. A few secondary industries are also included, though most should be built by yourself.

  Please report any issues to the TT-Forums thread. Thank you!
