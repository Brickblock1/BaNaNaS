name: "The Borders"
description: "This is a scenario of the border country between Scotland and England, from Arbroath in the North to Darlington in the South.  The towns are placed as accurately as I can get them, but apart from the five key cities that are large enough to have a bank, all are small. Industries have been placed to hopefully give a good game. Note that there are only a few processing industries of each type (sawmills, steel works etc.).  The game begins in 1935."
