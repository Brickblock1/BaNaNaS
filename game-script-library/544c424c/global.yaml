description: |-
  With this library scenario authors can place signs in the scenario editor and then use this library to query the locations of those signs from a GameScript.

  When you initialize the library it will remove all the label signs
  from the map and only store their location in memory.

  See the READEME for more info and main.nut for documentation of the public functions.
